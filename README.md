## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)

### Clone the Repository

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/game-data-hub.git
    cd game-data-hub
    ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:

    ```bash

    ```

### Firebase Setup

To use Firebase Authentication and Firestore, you need to set up Firebase:

1. Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
2. Create a new project and enable Firebase Authentication and Firestore.
3. Copy your Firebase configuration and create a `firebaseConfig.js` file in the `src` directory:

    ```javascript
    // src/firebaseConfig.js
    export const firebaseConfig = {
      apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
      authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
      projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
      storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
      messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
      appId: "YOUR_APP_ID"
    };
    ```

4. Ensure that Firebase Authentication and Firestore are correctly set up in your Firebase Console.

### Running the Application

1. Start the development server:

    ```bash
    pnpm run dev
    ```

2. Visit `http://localhost:5173` in your browser to view the application.
